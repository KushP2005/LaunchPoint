# 🚀 LaunchPoint – Spacecraft Control System
LaunchPoint is a high-performance spacecraft control system designed to manage and optimize real-time sensor data processing for space missions. Built in C with multi-threading, semaphores, and dynamic memory management, LaunchPoint ensures efficient resource allocation and system stability under extreme conditions.

## ✨ Features
🔹 Real-Time Sensor Management – Handles 1200+ sensors with dynamic arrays and linked lists for improved simulation consistency.<br>
🔹 Optimized Multi-Threading – Uses semaphores to prevent race conditions, achieving 1.5x faster synchronization.<br>
🔹 Event-Driven Architecture – Dynamically adjusts spacecraft resource allocation for adaptive performance tuning.<br>
🔹 Fault Tolerance & Efficiency – Reduces data inconsistencies and enhances system resilience in critical operations.<br>

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
🔹 Programming Language: C <br>
🔹 OS & Tools: VirtualBox, Linux, Bash <br>
🔹 Concurrency: POSIX Threads, Semaphores <br>

## 🚀 How It Works
Sensor Data Handling – Efficiently stores and processes sensor inputs using linked lists and dynamic arrays.<br>
Thread Synchronization – Uses semaphores to coordinate data processing across multiple threads.<br>
Event-Driven Logic – Detects anomalies and reallocates resources in real-time to maintain spacecraft stability.<br>
📌 Future Improvements<br>
Implement machine learning models for predictive system optimizations.<br>
Enhance GUI-based monitoring for real-time system visualization.<br>
